# Call Center Speech Analytics

## The Story: From Raw Audio to Actionable Business Intelligence

In the fast-paced world of customer service, call centers process thousands of conversations daily. Each call contains valuable insights about customer satisfaction, agent performance, and operational efficiency. However, manually analyzing these conversations is time-consuming and often subjective. This project transforms that challenge into an opportunity.

### The Problem We Solve

Call center managers face several critical challenges:
- **Quality Assurance Bottlenecks**: Manual call reviews are slow and inconsistent
- **Performance Blind Spots**: Limited visibility into agent effectiveness and customer sentiment
- **Missed Opportunities**: Valuable insights buried in hours of recorded conversations
- **Reactive Management**: Issues discovered too late, after customer relationships are damaged
- **Compliance Risks**: Difficulty ensuring consistent service standards across all interactions

### Our Solution: AI-Powered Speech Analytics

In this implementation, we use ElevenLabs' speech-to-text API to automatically analyze call recordings and extract meaningful business intelligence. Built with React Native developers in mind, it provides a complete pipeline from audio processing to executive dashboards.

- **Detailed logging** and error handling
- **Scalable architecture** for enterprise deployment

## The Technical Journey

### Phase 1: Speech-to-Text Foundation
We started with ElevenLabs' speech-to-text API, which provides:
- High-accuracy transcription with confidence scores
- Speaker diarization (who said what, when)
- Precise timing information for each word
- Support for various audio formats

### Phase 2: Business Intelligence Layer
Built sophisticated analytics on top of raw transcription data:
- Natural language processing for sentiment detection
- Pattern recognition for call outcomes
- Statistical analysis of conversation dynamics
- Key information extraction (account numbers, names, etc.)

### Phase 3: Visualization and Reporting
Created comprehensive dashboards that transform data into insights:
- Multi-chart analytics showing different perspectives
- Correlation analysis revealing hidden patterns
- Executive summaries with actionable recommendations
- Exportable reports for stakeholder communication
